<!-- Instructions:

 Use the Chocolate dataset and a Kruskal-Wallis Test(s) to answer an interesting question(s) that you come up with.
 
 About the dataset:
 
  * Company: Name of the company manufacturing the bar.

  * Orig: The specific geo-region of origin for the bar.

  * Review: Date of publication of the review.

  * Cocoa: Cocoa percentage (darkness) of the chocolate bar being reviewed.

  * Location: Manufacturer base country.

  * Rating: Expert rating for the bar.
      5= Elite (Transcending beyond the ordinary limits)
      4= Premium (Superior flavor development, character and style)
      3= Satisfactory(3.0) to praiseworthy(3.75) (well made with special qualities)
      2= Disappointing (Passable but contains at least one significant flaw)
      1= Unpleasant (mostly unpalatable)

   * Type: The variety (breed) of cocoa bean used, if provided.
   
   * BroadOrig: The broad geo-region of origin for the bean.

## Chocolate Ratings {.tabset .tabset-fade}


### Background
<div>

This analysis used the Chocolate dataset from Kaggle. The dataset included (among other things) different types of chocolate from 60 different countries rated on a scale of 1 to 5. I chose to narrow my search down to the four countries with the most samples of chololate given in the study. This lead to only using data from Canada, France, the U.K., and the United States.

$$
  H_0:  \text{All samples are from the same distribution}
$$
$$
  H_a:  \text{At least one sample's distribution is stochastically different}
$$


 I used a Kruskal-Wallis Test with a level of significance of .05 to evaluate if at least one of these four countries came from a different population than the rest based on their chocolate quality rating. The rating scale used is shown below.

Rating: Expert rating of the bar:
 
  5= Elite (Transcending beyond the ordinary limits)
  
  4= Premium (Superior flavor development, character and style)
  
  3= Satisfactory(3.0) to praiseworthy(3.75) (well made with special qualities)
  
  2= Disappointing (Passable but contains at least one significant flaw)
  
  1= Unpleasant (mostly unpalatable)

*Note that only two samples from the entire dataset were rated above 4 so we will consider the Premium rating a noteworthy accomplishment instead of being just second-best.*

### Analysis
<div>

Preforming a Kruskal-Wallis test veryfied that at least one of the four countries comes from a different population than the others. However, this is rather uninformative as we still are missing a large amount of information. We don't know which country is different than that others, if there is more than one country in this category, or if that country has better or worse chocolate than the others. All we know is that the data is worth a deeper investigation.


```r
pander(kruskal.test(data=choc.loc, as.factor(Rating)~as.factor(Location)))
```

Table: Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test: `as.factor(Rating)` by `as.factor(Location)`

Using a boxplot to give insights into the aforementioned shortcomings of the information provided by the Kruskal-Wallis test led to some interesting revelations. 


```r
plot_ly(data=choc.loc, x=~Location, y=~Rating, type="box") %>%
  layout(
    title = "Chocolate Bar Ratings",
    xaxis = list(title = "Country"),
    yaxis = list(title = "Chocolate Bar Rating",
                 range=c(0,4), 
                 tickvals=seq(1,4,1),

I had assumed that the different country would have better ratings than the others, but my assumption is that the outliers may have actually had slightly lower rater chocolate. Three of the countries had a median rating of 3.25 while the U.K. had a slightly lower median rating could be the different population. The other possiblity is that Canada is the different population since their chocolate has a higher third quantile than the others.
